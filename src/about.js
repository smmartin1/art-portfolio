            <p>
                The trouble with schools is/
                They always try to teach the wrong lesson/
                Believe me, I've been kicked out of enough of them to know/
                They want you to become less callow, less shallow/
                But I say, why invite stress in?/
                Stop studying strife/
                And learn to live "the unexamined life"
            </p>

            <p>
                Dancing through life/
                Skimming the surface/
                Gliding where turf is smooth/
                Life's more painless/
                For the brainless/
                Why think too hard?/
                When it's so soothing/
                Dancing through life/
                No need to tough it/
                When you can slough it off as I do/
                Nothing matters/
                But knowing nothing matters/
                It's just life/
                So keep dancing through/
            </p>
        </div>
